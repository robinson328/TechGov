# TechGov Protocol

A decentralized governance framework for emerging technology oversight, evaluation, and regulatory compliance.

## Overview

TechGov Protocol is a blockchain-based governance system designed to facilitate transparent, democratic decision-making for emerging technologies. The protocol enables stakeholders to propose, evaluate, and vote on technology standards, regulations, and innovation funding while ensuring compliance and risk management.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Governance**: Community-driven decision making for technology policies
- **Technology Assessment**: Systematic evaluation of emerging technologies
- **Compliance Tracking**: Automated monitoring of regulatory requirements
- **Innovation Funding**: Democratic allocation of resources for tech development
- **Risk Management**: Comprehensive risk evaluation and mitigation strategies
- **Standards Setting**: Collaborative establishment of industry standards
- **Stakeholder Management**: Multi-tier participation system for various stakeholders

## Architecture

The protocol consists of multiple interconnected smart contracts built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity, ensuring security, transparency, and immutability of governance processes.

## Smart Contracts

The protocol is powered by a suite of Clarity smart contracts that handle different aspects of technology governance:

- Governance core functionality
- Proposal management
- Voting mechanisms
- Stakeholder registration
- Technology assessment
- Compliance monitoring
- Risk evaluation
- Innovation funding
- Standards management
- Regulatory compliance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
